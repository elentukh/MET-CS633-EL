Four Poems by Anna Akhmatova "The Muse"
All that I am hangs by a thread tonight
as I wait for her whome no one can command
Whatever I cherish most - youth,freedom, glory -
fades before her who bears the flute in her hand
And look! She comes....she tosses back her veil,
staring me down, serene and pitiless
the lines of his inferno? She answers"Yes".
